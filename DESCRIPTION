Description: 
    This is a comprehensive package to perform
    Tensor decomposition based unsupervised feature extraction.
    It can perform unsupervised feature extraction.
    It uses tensor decompission.
    It is  applicable to gene expression, DNA methylation, and 
    histone modification etc.
    It can perform multiomics analysis.
    It is also applicable to single cell omics data sets.
